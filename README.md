# chatFilter
A simple chat filtering module to prevent scam messages appearing in chat

## Why?
Most of the third party chat filter to prevent scam messages do **not** care about the message's context, causing them to filter directly without "thinking". Which means, no matter what you said, even if it is not a scam message, you still will get affected by the filter if there are blacklisted words in it.

## Requirements

* Know how to code (obviously)
* Roblox Studio installation

## Setup
Put the main code into a module, create a folder in `Chat` called `ChatModules`, and finally put the module in it.l
